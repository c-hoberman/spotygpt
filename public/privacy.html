  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> May 9, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>[Your App Name]</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”) operates the website and API at <a href="https://spotygpt.onrender.com">https://spotygpt.onrender.com</a> (the “Service”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our Service, including via the Custom GPT Spotify integration.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spotify Authorization Token</strong><br />
      When you click “Authorize with Spotify,” we never see or store your Spotify password. Instead, we receive a time-limited access token and refresh token directly from Spotify via OAuth. We store these tokens in encrypted form solely to call the Spotify Web API on your behalf.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data</strong><br />
      We log API requests (endpoints called, timestamps) to monitor and debug the Service. These logs do <em>not</em> contain personal listening history or profile data beyond what you explicitly request (e.g., adding a track to a playlist).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>API Calls on Your Behalf</strong><br />
      We use your Spotify access token only to perform actions you’ve requested—such as adding tracks to your playlists. We do not read or store any other data from your account.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics &amp; Improvement</strong><br />
      We analyze aggregated, anonymized usage metrics (e.g., number of calls per day) to improve performance and reliability. No personal data is retained in analytics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tokens</strong><br />
      Your Spotify access and refresh tokens persist until you revoke access (in ChatGPT’s sidebar → “Revoke authorization”) or until they expire and refresh fail. After revocation or inactivity, tokens are deleted immediately.</li>
    <li><strong>Logs</strong><br />
      Request logs are retained up to 30 days and then permanently deleted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We rely on the following services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spotify, Inc.</strong> for OAuth authentication and Web API.</li>
    <li><strong>Render.com</strong> for hosting and environment management.</li>
    <li><strong>OpenAI / ChatGPT</strong> for the Custom GPT interface and OAuth callback handling.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All data in transit is encrypted via TLS (HTTPS).</li>
    <li>Tokens are stored encrypted at rest.</li>
    <li>Access to production environment variables is limited and audited.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access &amp; Deletion</strong><br />
      You can revoke our access at any time via Spotify’s Account Settings → Apps, or via the “Revoke authorization” button in ChatGPT’s sidebar. That will delete your tokens from our system.</li>
    <li><strong>Support</strong><br />
      If you need a copy of any data we hold about you or wish to request deletion of logs, please contact us.</li>
  </ul>
